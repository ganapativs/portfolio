## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue with this open source package, we would love to receive your report!

Please **DO NOT** open public issues or discussions about security vulnerabilities.

The owner of this repository uses GitHub Private Security Vulnerability reporting.

To report a vulnerability:

- On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Under the repository name, click **Security**.
  If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the dropdown menu, and then click **Security**.
- Click **Report a vulnerability** to open the advisory form.
- Fill in the advisory details form.
- At the bottom of the form, click **Submit report**.
  GitHub will display a message letting you know that maintainers have been notified
  and that you have a pending credit for this security advisory.
- _Optionally_, click **Start a temporary private fork** if you want to start to fix the issue.
  Note that only the repository maintainer can merge changes from that private fork
  into the parent repository.
